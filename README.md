# GeorgiaTechProject5-JavaGUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Code" is the Java code I wrote for this project.

- "Console Output Example" is a visual of what will be printed in the console if the user selects "add two frequencies" in the first dropdown menu (and subsequently adds 200 Hz + 200 Hz) and "get note for frequency" in the second dropdown menu.

- "GUI Output Example" is how the GUI looks (with the above parameters).

*Note: in order to run this program, a jar file must be installed which can be found on jfugue.org.
