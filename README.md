# GeorgiaTechProject5-JavaGUI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "Code" is the Java code I wrote for this project.

- "Console Output Example" is an example of what will be printed in the console if the user selects "add two frequencies" in the first dropdown menu (and subsequently adds 200 HZ + 200 HZ) and "get note for frequency" in the second dropdown menu.

- "GUI Output Example" is how the GUI looks (with the above parameters).
